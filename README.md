Data set available on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lorenzovzquez/pens-and-printers-product-sales

Analysis performed using Jupyter Notebook (Python) with description and full report contained in the notebook.

# Summary

Pens and Printers have developed a new product line and have been selling these new products for six weeks according to three different sales strategies: email which requires the least effort, call which requires the most effort and email + call which requires medium effort since the call is 3 times shorter than call alone. Apart from revenue and sales method over the six weeks they have also recorded customer_id, number of items sold, years as customer, number of site visits and state.

The data shows that the email and call strategy generated the most revenue per customer than either of the other two strategies, and this difference is significant enough to warrant switching to this strategy going forward even though it requieres more effort than email alone.
